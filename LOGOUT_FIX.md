# Fix: Logout Going to Blank Dashboard

## Problem
After clicking logout, the page was going to a blank dashboard instead of properly signing out and redirecting to the sign-in page.

## Root Cause
Two issues were causing this:

1. **Logout not calling Clerk's signOut()**: The logout function was only redirecting to `/sign-in` without actually signing out from Clerk
2. **Double navigation conflict**: The Header component was calling `logout()` then trying to navigate to `/login`, while the logout function was already redirecting to `/sign-in`

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated AuthContext Logout Function
**File: `apps/web/src/features/auth/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`**

**Before:**
```typescript
const logout = () => {
  // Clerk handles logout
  window.location.href = '/sign-in'
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
const logout = async () => {
  // Call Clerk's signOut method
  await signOut()
  // Redirect to sign-in page
  window.location.href = '/sign-in'
}
```

**Changes:**
- ✅ Now calls Clerk's `signOut()` method to properly clear session
- ✅ Made function `async` to wait for sign-out to complete
- ✅ Added `signOut` to destructured Clerk hooks
- ✅ Updated interface to reflect async return type

### 2. Fixed Header Logout Handler
**File: `apps/web/src/components/layouts/Header.tsx`**

**Before:**
```typescript
const handleLogout = () => {
  logout()
  navigate('/login')  // Conflicting navigation!
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
const handleLogout = async () => {
  await logout()
  // Logout function already handles redirect to /sign-in
}
```

**Changes:**
- ✅ Removed conflicting `navigate('/login')` call
- ✅ Made function `async` to properly await logout
- ✅ Let the logout function handle the redirect

## How It Works Now

**Logout Flow:**
```
1. User clicks "Logout" button in header
   ↓
2. handleLogout() called
   ↓
3. await logout() - calls Clerk's signOut()
   ↓
4. Clerk clears session and cookies
   ↓
5. Redirects to /sign-in
   ↓
6. ✅ User sees Clerk sign-in page
```

## Testing the Fix

1. **Sign in** to the web app
2. **Click** on your profile in the top right
3. **Click "Logout"**
4. **Expected Result:**
   - ✅ You're immediately signed out
   - ✅ Redirected to `/sign-in` page
   - ✅ Shows Clerk's sign-in form
   - ✅ No blank page
   - ✅ If you try to go back to dashboard, you're redirected to sign-in

## Files Modified

- ✅ `apps/web/src/features/auth/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
  - Added `signOut` from Clerk
  - Updated `logout()` to call `signOut()`
  - Changed logout return type to `Promise<void>`

- ✅ `apps/web/src/components/layouts/Header.tsx`
  - Removed conflicting navigation
  - Made `handleLogout` async
  - Properly awaits logout completion

## Why This Fix Works

**Problem 1 - Not Actually Logging Out:**
- Before: Only redirected URL, Clerk session remained active
- After: Calls Clerk's `signOut()` to properly clear session

**Problem 2 - Navigation Conflict:**
- Before: Trying to navigate to both `/login` and `/sign-in` simultaneously
- After: Single redirect handled by logout function

**Result:**
- ✅ Clean, proper logout
- ✅ No blank pages
- ✅ Session properly cleared
- ✅ User redirected to sign-in

## Additional Notes

- The logout is now `async` because Clerk's `signOut()` is asynchronous
- We wait for sign-out to complete before redirecting
- The redirect happens via `window.location.href` for a clean page reload
- This ensures all client-side state is cleared

## Summary

The logout now:
1. ✅ Properly signs out from Clerk
2. ✅ Clears all session data
3. ✅ Redirects to sign-in page
4. ✅ No blank screens
5. ✅ Can't access protected routes after logout
