Driver safety scoring systems use telematics data to monitor driving behavior, identify risks, and promote safer driving habits. When implemented effectively, these programs reduce accidents by up to 50% while cutting insurance costs by 20-30%. Here's your complete guide to building a successful driver safety program.

## Why Driver Safety Scoring Matters

**The Hidden Cost of Unsafe Driving**:
- Accidents cost fleets $60,000-$500,000 per incident
- Insurance premiums increase 20-40% after accidents
- Vehicle downtime averages 30 days per accident
- Medical claims and litigation can reach millions
- Reputation damage affects customer relationships

**Benefits of Safety Programs**:
- 30-50% reduction in accidents
- 20-30% lower insurance premiums
- 15-25% fuel savings from smoother driving
- Reduced vehicle wear and maintenance costs
- Improved driver retention and satisfaction

## Understanding Safety Scoring

### What Gets Measured

**Critical Safety Events**:
- Harsh braking (sudden deceleration)
- Aggressive acceleration
- Sharp cornering
- Speeding (absolute and relative)
- Following distance violations
- Distracted driving indicators
- Seatbelt usage

**Context Matters**:
- Time of day (rush hour vs. late night)
- Road conditions (highway vs. residential)
- Weather conditions
- Traffic density
- Vehicle type and load

### How Scores Are Calculated

**Common Scoring Models**:

**Event-Based** (0-100 scale):
- Start at 100 points
- Deduct points for each safety event
- Weight events by severity
- Calculate daily/weekly/monthly scores

**Rate-Based** (events per mile/hour):
- Count safety events over time
- Normalize by miles driven or engine hours
- Compare to fleet averages
- Track improvement trends

**Composite Score**:
- Combine multiple factors
- Weight different behaviors
- Account for positive behaviors (smooth driving)
- Adjust for driving conditions

### Industry Benchmarks

**Excellent**: 90-100
- <2 harsh events per 100 miles
- <5% speeding incidents
- Minimal accident risk

**Good**: 75-89
- 2-5 harsh events per 100 miles
- 5-10% speeding incidents
- Below-average accident risk

**Needs Improvement**: 60-74
- 6-10 harsh events per 100 miles
- 10-20% speeding incidents
- Above-average accident risk

**Critical**: <60
- >10 harsh events per 100 miles
- >20% speeding incidents
- High accident risk requiring immediate intervention
