## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Stories

#### Fleet Manager Journey
As a fleet manager, I need to monitor my entire fleet's performance, identify underutilized vehicles, schedule preventive maintenance, and generate compliance reports to optimize operations and reduce costs.

#### Dispatcher Journey
As a dispatcher, I need to assign routes to drivers, track real-time progress, receive alerts for delays or violations, and communicate with drivers to ensure efficient daily operations.

#### Driver Journey
As a driver, I need to receive my daily assignments, navigate routes, complete pre-trip checklists, and report incidents to fulfill my duties efficiently.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Company Onboarding
1. **Given** a new customer signs up, **When** they complete registration, **Then** they receive access to multi-tenant workspace with admin role
2. **Given** admin is logged in, **When** they add team members, **Then** each member receives invitation with appropriate role assignment
3. **Given** trial period is active, **When** 7 days remain, **Then** admin receives upgrade notification

#### Device Management
1. **Given** admin has device credentials, **When** they scan QR code or enter IMEI/serial, **Then** device is registered and appears in device list
2. **Given** device is registered, **When** it connects for first time, **Then** system displays device status as "Active" with health metrics
3. **Given** multiple devices exist, **When** admin creates device group, **Then** devices can be organized and managed collectively

#### Live Tracking
1. **Given** vehicle is moving, **When** manager views map, **Then** real-time location updates every 10 seconds
2. **Given** trip is in progress, **When** user selects vehicle, **Then** system displays speed, fuel level, odometer, engine hours
3. **Given** trip is completed, **When** user accesses history, **Then** complete trip playback with timeline is available

#### Geofencing
1. **Given** manager creates circular/polygon geofence, **When** vehicle enters boundary, **Then** entry alert triggers based on rules
2. **Given** geofence has exit alert enabled, **When** vehicle leaves boundary, **Then** exit notification sent to designated users
3. **Given** multiple geofences overlap, **When** vehicle is in zone, **Then** all applicable alerts trigger independently

#### Driver Behavior Monitoring
1. **Given** vehicle is in motion, **When** harsh braking detected, **Then** incident logged with timestamp, location, severity
2. **Given** driver completes week of trips, **When** manager views scorecard, **Then** performance metrics display with trend analysis
3. **Given** speeding violation occurs, **When** threshold exceeded, **Then** real-time alert sent to dispatcher and logged

#### Maintenance Management
1. **Given** vehicle reaches mileage threshold, **When** preventive maintenance due, **Then** service reminder triggers 7 days before
2. **Given** maintenance is scheduled, **When** service completed, **Then** record is logged with cost and next service date
3. **Given** anomaly detected in telemetry, **When** predictive system identifies issue, **Then** maintenance suggestion created

#### Route Optimization
1. **Given** dispatcher has multiple stops, **When** they create route, **Then** system suggests optimized sequence
2. **Given** route is optimized, **When** assigned to driver, **Then** driver receives navigation with all stops in sequence
3. **Given** driver is en route, **When** customer views tracking, **Then** accurate ETA displays based on current progress

#### Mobile App (Driver)
1. **Given** driver starts shift, **When** they open app, **Then** daily checklist and assigned routes display
2. **Given** driver is offline, **When** they complete checklist, **Then** data syncs when connection restored
3. **Given** incident occurs, **When** driver captures photo/voice note, **Then** incident report uploads automatically

#### Alerts & Notifications
1. **Given** custom alert rule exists, **When** condition met, **Then** notification sent via configured channel (email/SMS/push)
2. **Given** critical alert triggers, **When** first recipient doesn't acknowledge in 15 minutes, **Then** alert escalates to next level
3. **Given** multiple alerts occur, **When** user views dashboard, **Then** alerts display prioritized by severity

#### Reporting
1. **Given** manager schedules weekly report, **When** week ends, **Then** report generates and emails automatically
2. **Given** compliance audit needed, **When** manager requests driver hours report, **Then** detailed logs export as PDF/CSV
3. **Given** cost analysis requested, **When** date range selected, **Then** fuel consumption and maintenance costs calculated

### Edge Cases

- How does system handle device reporting conflicting locations?
- What happens when driver app is offline for extended period exceeding 48 hours? (Admin alert triggers)
- How are duplicate device registrations prevented?
- What happens when geofence rule conflicts with another rule?
- How does system handle remote engine control when vehicle is in motion?
- What happens when webhook endpoint is unavailable? (Retry 3 times with exponential backoff: 5s, 30s, 2min)
- How are timezone differences handled for global fleets?
- What happens when maximum geofence limit (500) is reached?
- How does system handle driver assignment to multiple vehicles simultaneously?
